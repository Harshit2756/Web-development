    -1. ID Selector
    .If we want to select the only paragraph to show any change, then we will be using ID selector.
    -2.Class Selector
    .If we want to select a paragraph and assign multiple properties to it, then we can use Class Selector. 
    -3.Hierachical Selectors
~ selector1 selector2 {} 
~ selector 1 is parent of selector2 i.e. selector2 is contained inside selector1 
~ Here the hierachy is from right to left i.e. selector2 is inside selector1 (left one is parent and right is child) 
~ #title .container-fluid this means the .container-fluid class which is inside the title id which is more specific 

    -4.Combined Selectors 
~ selector1.selector2{}     or    selector1#selector2{}   no space
~ e.x.  div.container-fluid{color:red} 

/priority of selectors
~ 1. ID selector
~ 2. Class selector
~ 3. Element selector
~ 4. Universal selector
~ 5. Attribute selector
~ 6. Pseudo-class selector
~ 7. Pseudo-element selector
~ 8. Combinator selector
~ 9. Grouping selector
~ 10. Negation selector

 ~ Don't use inline styles can cause various bugs 
 ~ Use the ID selector very rarely for like sections or where there is linking of sections 
~ If there is only one element of type also then also use class selector over ID selector  
 ~ Don't Use multiple classes for the same element
