    /A block-level element always starts on a new line. 
    / A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). 
    / A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not. 
    / Eg:- <p>,<form>,<ol>,<li> -->
